INNER JOIN :


Payments table contains customerID, chequeNumber, paymentDate, paymentAmount.
Customer name is stored in customer table.

-- I want to extract the customer name and show it along with the payments table.

SELECT *
FROM payments
INNER JOIN customers
        ON payments.customerID = customers.customerID;

-- Here a lot of columns will be shown. The customerID column will be displayed twice, once from Payments table and another time from Customers table.


SELECT payments.customerID,
       customerName,
       amount,
       paymentDate
FROM payments
INNER JOIN customers
        ON payments.customerID = customers.customerID;

-- Here if we don't specify we want customerID from which table, it will give an error.

-- Also, we can give an alias to table names to make the code more concise.

SELECT p.customerID,
       customerName,
       amount,
       paymentDate
FROM payments p
INNER JOIN customers c
        ON p.customerID = c.customerID;

-- We will just need to write the alias after the table name.

JOINING MULTIPLE TABLES :


-- Orders table will have customerID, using which we can join the Customers table to retrieve the name of the customer who has placed the particular order.

SELECT * 
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
  ON c.customerID = o.customerID;

SELECT orderNumber,
       status,
       o.customerID,
       c.customerName,
    -- c.salesRepEmployeeNumber,
       e.firstName AS "Sales Person Name",
       e.jobTitle
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
  ON c.customerID = o.customerID
JOIN employees e
  ON c.salesRepEmployeeNumber = e.employeeNumber;


-- A sales person will have multiple customers and each customer will have multiple orders.
-- one-to-many, one-to-many

SELF JOIN


Here we join the table with itself.

-- In the employees table, there is the name of the employee and the employeeID of the person each employee reports to
My objective is to display the name of the employee each person reports to.

SELECT *
FROM employees emp
JOIN employees mgr
        ON emp.reportsTo = mgr.employeeNumber;






-- self join
-- in the employees table, there is the employee number and name
-- and there is the column 'reportsTo' that has the employee number of the 
-- employee one has to report to

-- now i want to display the name and job title of the persons each employee reports to

-- for that we will join the employee table with itself

SELECT emp.employeeID, 
       emp.employeeName,
       emp.reportTo,
       mgr.employeeName AS 'mgrName'
       mgr.jobTitle AS 'mgrTitle'
FROM employees emp
JOIN employees mgr
  ON emp.reportsTo = mgr.employeeID;

IMPLICIT JOIN : 

Explicit Join : where we are joining tables using the join keyword.
Example:c        SELECT      payments.customerID,
                    customerName,
                    amount,
                    paymentDate
        FROM        payments
        INNER JOIN  customers
                ON  payments.customerID = customers.customerID;


Implicit Join : In implicit join, we don't use the JOIN keyword.
Example:
        SELECT      p.customerID,
                    customerName,
                    amount,
                    paymentDate
        FROM        payments p, customers c
        WHERE       p.customerID = c.customerID;

CROSS JOIN:

Here, every entry of the first table is joined with each of the entries in the second table.
Thus in there are 10 rows in the first table and 20 rows in the second table, the output displayed will have 200 rows in total.



___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



OUTER JOIN : 

Problem with Inner Join: we don't get all the entries in the output, the entries which satisfy only the inner join condition are displayed

To understand: what orders have been placed by each customer using INNER JOIN

SELECT c.customerNumber, customerName, o.orderNumber
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o
  ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber;

This query will not display the customers that haven't placed any orders.
But suppose we want to display those customers too and the orderNumber column should display NULL

-- SELECT customers who have not placed any orders

SELECT c.customerNumber
FROM customers c
WHERE
