SQL is used a lot for summarising data.

Some real-life business usecases are:
 - No of orders placed daily or monthly
 - No of unique customers every month
 - Yearwise increase in profits or sales
 - Monthwise increase in enrolments
 - Average ratings per course


For these tasks, we'll use Aggregate Functions in MySQL. They are:
 - MAX()
 - MIN()
 - AVG()
 - SUM()
 - COUNT()
