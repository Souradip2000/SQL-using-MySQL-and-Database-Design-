SQL is used a lot for summarising data.

Some real-life business usecases are:
 - No of orders placed daily or monthly
 - No of unique customers every month
 - Yearwise increase in profits or sales
 - Monthwise increase in enrolments
 - Average ratings per course


For these tasks, we'll use Aggregate Functions in MySQL. They are:
 - MAX()
 - MIN()
 - AVG()
 - SUM()
 - COUNT()


SELECT 
     MAX(amount)  AS "highestPayment",
     MIN(amount),
     AVG(amount),
     SUM(amount),
FROM 
     payments;

COUNT(): this only counts the not null values

SELECT COUNT(placedDate) AS totalOrders,
       COUNT(shippedDate) AS shippedOrders
FROM orders;
Output:
totalOrders - 326
shippedOrders - 312

This shows that the records with NULL value in 'shippedOrders' field has not been counted by the COUNT function.

to count all the rows we use:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalOrders
FROM orders;

COUNT(*) counts all the rows in the table.


-- TO FIND ORDERS THAT ARE IN PROCESS : demonstrates we can use COUNT() with other clauses too

SELECT COUNT(*) AS Under process
FROM orders
WEHRE status = "In progress";


-- FIND OUT MOST RECENT ORDER FROM ORDERS TABLE : to demonstrate we can use MAX(), MIN() with strings, dates, etc. other than numeric data

SELECT 
     MAX(paymentDate),
     MIN(paymentDate),
FROM orders;

maximum of paymentDate is the largest date and the most recently placed order
same for minimum

I can do the same for strings.
The lexicographically largest string will be the one that comes later in the dictionary.

SELECT 
     MAX(chequeNumber),
     MIN(chequeNumber),
FROM orders;

GROUP BY clause : 
using it with aggregate functions

-- query to find how many total products are there in the products table
SELECT 
    COUNT(*)
FROM products;

-- query to find the total categories there are in the products table
SELECT
    DISTINCT productLine
FROM products;

-- query to find the count of products in each category
SELECT
    productLine,
    COUNT(*)    AS productCount
FROM products
GROUP BY productLine;





-- GROUP BY            SYNTAX

SELECT 
    c1,c2,...,cN, aggregate function(ci)
FROM 
    table
WHERE
    condition  -- this will be used to filter out (eg. the locations only in Asia)
GROUP BY 
    c1,c2,...,cN;

the aggregate function is not included in the GROUP BY clause.






-- select the count of employees that work in the same office, their office code and the office location 
SELECT 
    e.officeCode,
    o.city,
    COUNT(employeeID)
FROM employees e
JOIN offices o
  ON e.officeCode = o.officeCode
GROUP BY e.officeCode, o.city;

In the above query it will be completely fine if we don't mention o.city in the GROUP BY clause
because officeCode - city is a one-one mapping.
But if it was a one-to-many mapping, then there would have been difficulties.

Suppose:
OfficeCode    -    City
1             -    San Francisco
1             -    London
1             -    Delhi
1             -    Mumbai
2             -    Pune

In this case if we would have written only GROUP BY office code, 
then 
for officeCode = 1, a random city name would have been displayed.

All the cities of officeCode = 1 would have been grouped as a single entity.

But the problem with writing all 3 parameters is the query will take more time to execute. 
Thus we should write only one if it will do the work just fine.

The above query can also be written with the USIGN clause instead of ON clause:
SELECT 
    e.officeCode,
    o.city,
    COUNT(employeeID)
FROM employees e
JOIN offices o
  USING (officeCode)
GROUP BY e.officeCode, o.city;

HAVING clause:

filter out offices having more than 4 employees

SELECT 
    e.officeCode,
    o.city,
    COUNT(employeeID) AS employeeCount
FROM employees e
JOIN offices o
  USING (officeCode)
WHERE employeeCount > 4    --     this line will give an error : because the employeeCount column hasn't yet been formed
GROUP BY e.officeCode, o.city; 


We can use the WHERE clause for columns that have not used aggregated functions like
