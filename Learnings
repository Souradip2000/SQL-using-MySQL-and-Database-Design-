SELECT DISTINCT

DISTINCT keyword : used to select only unique records

MOD(col_name, value)

MOD keyword : calculates the modulus of the col_value

UPPER(), LOWER(), SUBSTR():

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY,1,1)) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u') 
  AND LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY,-1)) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

RIGHT(str, 3) - will fetch the last three characters of the string
LEFT(str, 3) - fetch the left(first) three characters of the string

Use joins because:
   1. we might have to store the same data multiple times
   2. if we need to change the data, then we will only have to change it in one place 
eg. ORDERS table only contains customerID and not customerName because multiple orders can be placed by the same customer and thus...
