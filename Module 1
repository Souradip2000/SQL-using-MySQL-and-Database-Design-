What is a database?
A: A database is a collection of data stored in a particular format such that it can be accessed and updated easily.

Why do we need a database?
A: Online applications like Amazon will need a database to store the user account details, the delivery address, the order status as well as all product info.

We must be easily be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) these databases.
Interaction with these databases need to fast and optimised. Otherwise, it'll affect the application's performance.

How do we work with databases?
A: Using a database management system(DBMS). We use this to maintain consistency in the database. So that we don't enter things like 69 under the name col
   that will be an invalid entry.

There are two types of databases:
i. Relational db : SQL Db
ii. NoSQL Db

Differences between i and ii:

SQL can be used to query relational db.
SQL cannot be used to query NoSQL db. They have their own query language.

Main difference is in terms of the way data is stored.
RDBMS stores data in the form of tables that might be related to one another.
NoSQL stores data in a more complex form.

Examples:
RDBMS : MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server
NoSQL : MongoDB, Firebase, etc. All these have specific purpose, store specific types of data, and have specific use cases.
