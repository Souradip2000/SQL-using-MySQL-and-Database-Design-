What is a database?
A: A database is a collection of data stored in a particular format such that it can be accessed and updated easily.

Why do we need a database?
A: Online applications like Amazon will need a database to store the user account details, the delivery address, the order status as well as all product info.

We must be easily be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) these databases.
Interaction with these databases need to fast and optimised. Otherwise, it'll affect the application's performance.

How do we work with databases?
A: Using a database management system(DBMS). We use this to maintain consistency in the database. So that we don't enter things like 69 under the name col
   that will be an invalid entry.

What is a DBMS?
A: It is an interface between the end user and a database allowing users to create,read,update and delete data in the database.

There are two types of databases:
i. Relational db : SQL Db
ii. NoSQL Db

Differences between i and ii:

SQL can be used to query relational db.
SQL cannot be used to query NoSQL db. They have their own query language.

Main difference is in terms of the way data is stored.
RDBMS stores data in the form of tables that might be related to one another.
NoSQL stores data in a more complex form.

Examples:
RDBMS : MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server
NoSQL : MongoDB, Firebase, etc. All these have specific purpose, store specific types of data, and have specific use cases.

Relational Database:  It is a way of representing data in the form of tables.

- each row in the table is a record with a unique id:
the first column is primary key and it will have a unique id for every row

- the columns of the table hold attributes of the data
eg: name, ph no of the customer

- the relational model provides a standard way of representing and querying data that can be used by any application

- Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to write and query data in a database.

Example:

A table consists of ProdID, Prod_Name, CategoryID and Price. Another table consists of CategoryId, CategoryName and Description.
We use CategoryID to link these two tables because it will save space and also be efficient in case we would want to change the Category name Clothing to Clothes.


Summary:
- Sql db are relatiional, NoSql db are not
- sql db use sql for querying, NoSql db have their own querrying languages
- sql db have a predefined schema(relations), NoSql db have dynamic schemas
- sql db are vertically scalable, nosql db are horizontally scalabel( related to system design ).
- sql db are table based, nosql db can be document, key-value pair, graph or wide column stores based, they use a storage model that is optimised for the
type of data that is being stored

Some applications of RDBMS :
- track inventories, - sales, - ecommerce transactions, - banking, -finance, -billing
